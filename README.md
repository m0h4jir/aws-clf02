# Important Note:
The Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam has notably increased its emphasis on the Security & Compliance domain. Continuing the trend seen in other recent AWS certification updates, the weight of security-related topics has risen — from 25% in CLF-C01 to 30% in CLF-C02.

Additionally, two of the previous exam domains have been renamed to better reflect their scope:

“Technology” is now “Cloud Technology & Services”

“Billing and Pricing” has been updated to “Billing, Pricing, and Support”

These changes highlight AWS’s growing focus on security and operational support within its certifications.
